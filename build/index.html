                            <p>&ldquo;Attention is the basic currency of the modern economy&rdquo;.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Use content as a train of thought, if it's not there, don't expect the user to get to where you want them to.</p>

                            <h3>Key Points &amp; Quotes</h3>
                            <p>Create &ldquo;Time Pressure&rdquo; Stop procastinators, motivate people. </p>
                            <p>Find more than one solution, if the main fails, somsthing to fall back on.</p>
                            <p>Everyone brainstorms, everyone.</p>
                            <p>Submit ideas (Post-its) and then people vote. No discussion, this approach removes over-discussion and frees people up to be honest with their views.</p>
                            <h3>Practical uses for eBusiness?</h3>
                            <p>I can see the brainstorm and voting idea working for large projects with different angles and opinions. Having everyone inbolved may pose a problem but I think it's something we should strive towards, team spirit, valuing opinions etc</p>

                            <h3>Workshop Topic</h3>
                            <p>A deep dive into Lean UX, in particular 'Hypothesis Writing'.</p>
                            <p>To quote the description of the workshop:</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;No one admits it but too often, requirements are just guesses. To cover up this uncomfortable fact, software managers do a vast amount to work on requirements: they pre-plan in painstaking detail, outlining every possible scenario, use case, back-end integration point, and business rule. The end result of all this planning? Too often, itâ€™s disappointment, frustration, and vast sums of wasted money&rdquo; .</p>
                            <p>We were broken up into teams, providid with post-its and Sharpies and worked through an excerise outlining user types, scenarioes, features and benefits etc.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the excersise we had identified a number of user types, their requirements and how the product would target these needs.</p>
                            <h3>Practical uses for eBusiness?</h3>
                            <p>Ties into Agile so very useful.</p>
                            <p>Workshop leaders have the following book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652">Lean UX</a>, which I will be buying.</p>
                            <p>Despite not having 1st hand contact with our user base I think an excerise like this will help us identify the user needs of the project, quicker and clearer, help remove assumptions and produce a superior end product.</p>
